# Tales of Interest [![Code Climate][cci]][cc] #

This is a custom Ruby on Rails CMS for the podcast network [Tales of Interest][1].

Feel free if you'd like to use it, I would appriciate if you could change the look a bit, though.
Right now the side is tailered to our use case, if you hit something that could be made a bit broader just open an issue or create a pull request with the changes.
